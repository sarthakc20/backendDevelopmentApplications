To be honest I wasn't such familiar with Typescript. So first I went through the typescript. Then I got some confidence to write code on typescript.

Then I started installing the essential dependencies starting with express to all the dependencies which may help me to build the to-do list backend. And then I set up the typescript environment with all required dependencies.


Then I created the root file "app.ts" in a folder called backend and assigned a PORT number to the backend to run.


Then I connected the app with MongoDB to store the data.


I created a folder called Model to keep the schema. I named it "toDoModel.ts" and I created a schema with a todo field. Because in a to-do list app we just need one schema which is the to-do or task, unless the app is complex, such as user authentication and more features. But we're not going that deep. So I was continuing with my to-do schema.

Then I created the "todoController.ts" file where i basically created the CRUD api, and also created the "todoRoutes.ts" file to handel the routes.At that point my backend was ready to perform the tasks.

Then I tested the apis with Postman, there was some errors which i fixed then and there. Then the backend was all done.

Then I created the frontend using npx create-react-app, as I wanted to do the frontend with React.

I installed redux to manage the states. With reducer, action I connected the backend to frontend

Finally I created the components and it was ready to use.
